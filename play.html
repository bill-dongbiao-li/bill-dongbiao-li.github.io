      How to Play Mahjong(Playing)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="text-left">Mahjong is a tile-based game that originated in China and is now popular worldwide. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles, which are divided into three suits: bamboo, characters, and circles. Each suit has tiles numbered from 1 to 9, and there are four of each tile. Additionally, there are honor tiles, which include dragons and winds, and flower tiles that are often used in special variations of the game. The objective of the game is to create sets of tiles, either in sequences of three or four tiles of the same suit, or in sets of three or four identical tiles. Players take turns drawing and discarding tiles until one player creates a winning hand that meets the specific requirements of the game being played. Mahjong is typically played with four players, although there are variations that can be played with two or three players. The game is often played with a scoring system that rewards players for certain combinations or patterns in their hand. Mahjong is a game that requires strategy, calculation, and skill, as players must carefully consider the tiles they choose to keep and discard, as well as the tiles being discarded by other players. The game is often played socially, with players gathering around a table to play and chat.<br>

    <ol>
      <li class="ol_list"> &nbsp;<strong>Basic points:</strong>Â In most variations of Mahjong, each set of tiles has a certain point value. Pungs and kongs (four identical tiles) are typically worth more than chows (three consecutive tiles of the same suit). Honor tiles and bonus tiles can also have point values.
        <ul>
          <li>Keep in mind that other players may pick up the tiles you discard. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp; <strong>Fan: </strong>The scoring system in Mahjong is based on the concept of "fan," which are points that can be accumulated based on the composition of the hand. For example, having a pair of dragons in the hand might give one fan, while having all three dragons could give three fans.</li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Limit hands:</strong> Some hands are worth a fixed number of points, regardless of the composition of the hand. These hands are known as "limit hands" and can be very valuable.</li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Settle the scores.</strong> Winning and losing: In most Mahjong variations, the player who wins the game receives points from the other players. After someone has won the round, you will need to calculate the scores for each player.
        <ul>
          <li>4 Pungs earns 6 points </li>
          <li>4 Chows earns 2 points </li>
          <li>1 Dragon Pung or Kong earns 2 points </li>
          <li>2 Dragon Pungs earns 6 points </li>
          <li>Pung or Kong of Winds matching dominant Wind for the round earns 2 points </li>
          <li>Flowers or Seasons tile earns 1 point </li>
        </ul>
