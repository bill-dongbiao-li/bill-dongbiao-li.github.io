        How to Play Mahjong (About the Game)&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </h1>
      <p class="text-left">
        Mahjong is a tile-based game that originated in China and is now
        popular worldwide. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles, which
        are divided into three suits: bamboo, characters, and circles. Each
        suit has tiles numbered from 1 to 9, and there are four of each tile.
        Additionally, there are honor tiles, which include dragons and winds,
        and flower tiles that are often used in special variations of the
        game. The objective of the game is to create sets of tiles, either in
        sequences of three or four tiles of the same suit, or in sets of three
        or four identical tiles. Players take turns drawing and discarding
        tiles until one player creates a winning hand that meets the specific
        requirements of the game being played. Mahjong is typically played
        with four players, although there are variations that can be played
        with two or three players. The game is often played with a scoring
        system that rewards players for certain combinations or patterns in
        their hand. Mahjong is a game that requires strategy, calculation, and
        skill, as players must carefully consider the tiles they choose to
        keep and discard, as well as the tiles being discarded by other
        players. The game is often played socially, with players gathering
        around a table to play and chat.<br >

          &nbsp;<strong>About the tiles.Â </strong>Mahjong is typically played
          with a set of 144 tiles, which includes tiles in three suits
          (bamboo, characters, and circles) numbered one to nine, four
          directional tiles (north, south, east, and west), three honor tiles
          (red, green, and white dragons), and eight bonus tiles (four flowers
          and four seasons). Your Mah Jongg set should include:
          <ul>
            <li>36 Bamboo tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9</li>
            <li>36 Chinese Character tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9</li>
            <li>36 Circle tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9</li>
            <li>12 Dragon tiles, 4 red, 4 green , and 4 white</li>
            <li>
              16 Wind tiles, 4 of each wind direction (North, South, East, and
              West)
            </li>
            <li>4 Flower tiles numbered 1-4</li>
            <li>4 Season tiles, numbered 1-4</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="ol_list">
          &nbsp;<strong> The combinations.</strong> There are just three
          different kinds of tile combinations that you will be trying to make
          as you play Mah Jongg. These combinations include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chow: a run of the same type of three tiles, such as three
              Chinese character tiles numbered 2, 3, and 4
            </li>
            <li>
              Pong: a set of three tiles, such as three number 2 Bamboo tiles
            </li>
            <li>
              Kong: a set of four tiles, such as four number 5 Circle
              tiles&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="ol_list">
          &nbsp;<strong> The object of the game.</strong> The objective of the
          game is to build a winning hand of 14 tiles by drawing and
          discarding tiles until one of the players has a winning hand. A
          winning hand typically consists of four sets of three tiles and a
          pair of matching tiles. The sets can be either three of a kind
          (called pungs) or a sequence of three consecutive tiles in the same
          suit (called chows).

              A game of Mah Jongg usually includes 16 rounds so that each
              player has a chance to be the dominant wind four times. Players
              earn points when they win a round and at the end of 16 rounds,
              the player with the most points is the winner.
