      How to Play Mahjong (Rules)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="text-left">Mahjong is a tile-based game that originated in China and is now popular worldwide. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles, which are divided into three suits: bamboo, characters, and circles. Each suit has tiles numbered from 1 to 9, and there are four of each tile. Additionally, there are honor tiles, which include dragons and winds, and flower tiles that are often used in special variations of the game. The objective of the game is to create sets of tiles, either in sequences of three or four tiles of the same suit, or in sets of three or four identical tiles. Players take turns drawing and discarding tiles until one player creates a winning hand that meets the specific requirements of the game being played. Mahjong is typically played with four players, although there are variations that can be played with two or three players. The game is often played with a scoring system that rewards players for certain combinations or patterns in their hand. Mahjong is a game that requires strategy, calculation, and skill, as players must carefully consider the tiles they choose to keep and discard, as well as the tiles being discarded by other players. The game is often played socially, with players gathering around a table to play and chat.<br>

    <h2 class="text-left">Part 2: Starting the Game</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Set up the game:</strong> First, you need to set up the Mahjong tiles. The set includes 144 tiles, which are shuffled and then stacked into a wall. The wall is then arranged into a square with two walls of tiles facing each other. The dealer then rolls the dice to determine which wall to break, and the tiles are arranged in a long line facing outwards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Â </li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Draw and discard tiles:</strong> Each player draws 13 tiles and then takes turns drawing and discarding tiles until they have a winning hand. Players can only draw tiles from the wall or from the discarded tiles.&nbsp; </li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Form sets:</strong> To win the game, players must form sets of tiles. A set can be a pung (three identical tiles), a chow (three consecutive tiles of the same suit), or a pair (two identical tiles). Players can also form bonus sets of tiles by matching the flowers or seasons. </li>
      <li class="ol_list">&nbsp;<strong>Declare Mahjong:</strong> If a player has a winning hand, they declare "Mahjong" and reveal their tiles. If no other player can form a better hand, the player wins the game.
        <ul>
          <li>The player whose wind direction is dominant for this round gets an extra tile. That player will get 14 tiles total while the rest of the players get 13. </li>
        </ul>
		</li>
      </ol>
